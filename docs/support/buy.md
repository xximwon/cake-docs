# Buy support

Cake Wallet currently supports Onramper, Robinhood Connect, and DFX for purchasing cryptocurrencies into your wallet.

## Onramper

We use an [Onramper](https://onramper.com) widget to display most crypto providers. If you have an issue with the widget itself, please contact Cake Wallet support. 

If you need support with your exchange provider, please find the support info for your provider on the [Onramper Knowledge](https://knowledge.onramper.com/how-can-i-get-help) website.
