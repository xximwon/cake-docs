In this case, the server will track login attempts, and if there are repeated TOTP failures, they should lock the account.</p> <p>In Cake Wallet, there are no servers that can serve this purpose. Thus, brute force prevention is extremely difficult, and there is no way to guarantee that the wallet app will be able to fully protect against brute force attempts.</p> <p>A casual attacker who is interacting with the unmodified Cake Wallet user interface will be unable to make enough guesses to reliably bypass the TOTP code. The Cake Wallet UI will restrict further authentication attempts for three minutes if there are three consecutive TOTP failures. Thus, for a 50% chance of success, a casual attacker will need to continuously type in codes this way for over 200 years.</p> <p>However, sophisticated attackers won't necessarily be limited by this UI. A sophisticated attacker (depending on the security of the device or operating system) could potentially take the Cake Wallet files, export them, and then interact with them using custom software that bypasses these rate limits.
